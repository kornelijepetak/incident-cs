Randomization library for .NET
Inspired by the [chance.js](http://chancejs.com/) library.

Over **70 different things** to randomize!

## Randomization areas:
- [x] Primitives (numbers, strings, etc.)
- [x] Textual elements (words, sentences and paragraphs)
 - [ ] LoremIpsum
- [x] Human related (names, birthdays, etc.)
 - [ ] Phones
- [x] Web elements (domains, urls, colors)
- [x] Business data
- [x] Games related
- [x] Geographic data

## Wiki
